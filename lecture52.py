'''
Classes & Objects (OOPS): Object oriented programming is a way of programming by creating objects.  
Object is something which is derived from the class template.

class is like a template.
object is something which is created using this template of class. Objhect is sometime also regraded as instance of class.

Why we create a class?
Because the OOPS followss the DRY concept which is do not repeat yourself. OOPS helps in saving the time and efforts.

difference between the function and the class is that class restricts the access of the function.
